# MultiAgent Traffic Control Using Transformers

Recent advances in multi-agent reinforcement learning have been largely limited training one model from scratch for every new task. This limitation occurs due to the restriction of the model architecture related to fixed input and output di- mensions, which hinder the experience accumulation and transfer of the learned agent over tasks across diverse levels of difficulty. Among these Multi-Agent Traffic Control is a hot topic research. So, here I have implemented the **UNIVERSAL MULTI - AGENT REINFORCEMENT LEARNING VIA POLICY DECOUPLING WITH TRANSFORMERS (UPDET)** on a custom build Multiagent Traffic Env.

# Environemnt Used

As said before the enviroment which I have used is a custom build environemnt of Traffic control with varied difficulities and number of agents. The demo of the env is shown below.
